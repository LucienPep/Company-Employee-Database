### Work Description
I started by creating the SQL files schema and seed to start table structure and add in useable data. I then started on the console.log end in index and practiced with sql queries as I was still un familiar with their function. I then created the inquirer prompt to ask the users the designed questions, then assigned them to run functions that would run individual queries. I then one by one created the functions to perform the desired task using a collection of functions and queries. Once required functionality was completed I continued onto the bonus objectives where I found a lot of queries shared similar paths to what I had already created. I had a few issues with using for loops and I spent a lot of time figuring out how to achieve the final task of totalling up the salary amounts, after playing around with a lot of different functions of pushing and joining arrays I was able to come up with a good solution that looks for how many employees are in each department and totals that amount. I then went back and cleared up a few queries that I figured out how to optimise better and removed all test console.logs.

### Installation

For this application express, inquirer, console-table-printer and mysql2 need to be installed. This can be done using npm install in console.

### Usage

express is used as the call location for our server calls and routing. inquirer was used to ask questions through the command line. Console-table-printer is used to print the SQL results into the console in a nicely formatted table. Mysql2 is used to add and retrieve data from sql files and utilise sql queries and the database.
